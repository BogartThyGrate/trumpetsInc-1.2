              <p className="secondaryTitle">SYNOPSIS</p>
              <p>
                Widows, Orphans, and Wildebeests confront the unlikely yet
                timely and not-too-pleasant issue of separation and its effects
                on the people involved. <br />
                Widows are the women who are virtually widowed although their
                husbands are still alive. Amanda, Bernie, Carol, Dina, and FLora
                tell their respective stories of physical and emotional abuse,
                abandonment, financial insecurity, and the resulting heartbreak,
                pain, and loneliness.
                <br />
                Orphans are the children whose parents are not dead but who, for
                all practical purposes, may as well be. Nico, MJ, Trixie,
                Karina, Iggy, Robby, and Susie are the innocent victims who sing
                of their bewilderment, their inner torment, their helplessness,
                and their anger. <br />
                Wildebeests are the fears, the nightmares, the problems that
                beset marriages. In this musical poem, wildebeests are also the
                men, perpetrators who become victims of their own “crimes,”
                going through their own personal, self-made hell, often
                oblivious or just indifferent to the havoc they are wreaking,
                but also isolated, confused, and afflicted. <br />
                Not an altogether beautiful story, but one that must be told,
                especially since there is HOPE.
