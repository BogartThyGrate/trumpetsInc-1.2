              <p>
              Pamilya Maleta is the story of a family whose life is ridden with problems which are reflective of those that plague many Filipino families today. Berto, the father, is a drunkard who escapes from his responsibilities by turning to the bottle. Kikay, his wife, is a Japayuki who supplements her earnings by running a one-woman recruitment agency for ambitious and desperate young girls. They have four children: Talino is an arrogant wannabe intellectual who complains about being born into the wrong family. Betchay is a happy-go-lucky tomboy who has a penchant for stealing. Rosanna changes boyfriends like she changes shirts in a week. And Tan-G-A, the youngest, is the simple-minded but affectionate brother who is appreciated only by his sisters.
              </p>
              <p>
              The story of Pamilya Maleta takes the audience through the often comic, sometimes tragic tale of a family whose story can also be our own. Each time, it has never failed to regale the audience with its songs and its endearing brand of humor at one moment, and then move them to tears at the next, when Pamilya Inusisa seems to be at its lowest and when it triumphs in the end.

          Supporting Trumpets Theater is more than just backing a theater; it is
          also about promoting community participation through the arts. The
          theater acts as a cultural hub, encouraging creativity and celebrating
          varied viewpoints. Patrons who support Trumpets Theater help to
          develop their community's cultural landscape by allowing local artists
          and performers to showcase their talents. This gift contributes to the
          theater's purpose of entertaining, educating, and inspiring audiences
          via meaningful storytelling and performances that appeal to people of
          all ages and backgrounds.

          Furthermore, supporting Trumpets Theater represents an investment in
          the future of the performing arts. The theater frequently interacts
          with schools, providing educational programs that introduce children
          to the wonder of theater and foster artistic expression. These efforts
          not only encourage creativity, but also instill discipline and
          teamwork in participants. Donors and sponsors who support such
          initiatives help to shape the next generation of artists and
          theatergoers, ensuring a strong cultural heritage for years to come.
