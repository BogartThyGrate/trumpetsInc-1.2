              <p>
              This touching tale by Oscar Wilde is retold in musical form by Jaime del Mundo and Luna Griño-Inocian with inspired music by Lito Villareal. Taking the story out of Wilde’s accustomed melancholy, it is given the feel of a Walt Disney animated feature through heartwarming characters, and spirited music without losing its more moving moments
              </p>
              <p>
              The story opens with a jovial nanny inviting the audience to view the tale of The Young King - a colorful story about a young shepherd boy suddenly called by a dying king and named his heir. 
              </p>
              <p></p>
              <p>
              The young boy is trained rigorously in the matters of the court, however, he becomes so mesmerized by the riches and luxuries of palace life that he loses sight of his purpose as the next King. When the young boy experiences three eye-opening dreams, he learns the truth about the plight of his people and what it means to be a genuine and humble ruler.
