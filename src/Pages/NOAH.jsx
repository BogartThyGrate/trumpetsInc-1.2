              Imagine a world full of garbage… Not that difficult to do, huh? Well, that’s exactly the kind of world Mr. Noah and his family live in. Mr. Noah has to clean up after all his neighbors who just couldn’t care less what they do with their lives as long as they have fun all day long. Mr. Noah looks at this world and prays for a solution to their garbage dilemma. Not long after, the Creator of all things, God, comes into the picture. He asks Noah to build him a boat, but not just any kind of boat,  a VERY BIG BOAT - AN ARK. He also orders that two of every kind of animal in the world be brought into the ark and that Noah and his family leave everything they have behind and come onboard as well. Though startled at the idea, Mr. Noah (with a “little” reservation) obeys. Rain breaks loose and the earth is submerged under water for 40 days and 40 nights. Noah and the animals are saved, but bored on the Ark. After finding different ways to amuse themselves, they realize how lucky they are and what a responsibility they have for future generations. Soon after, the Ark hits land. The garbage problem is solved. No surprise there. Noah and family stand in awe at God’s BIG PICTURE sealed with a reminder of HIs promise, a beautiful rainbow.
