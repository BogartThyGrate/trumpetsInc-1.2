              <p>
              Pamilya Maleta is the story of a family whose life is ridden with problems which are reflective of those that plague many Filipino families today. Berto, the father, is a drunkard who escapes from his responsibilities by turning to the bottle. Kikay, his wife, is a Japayuki who supplements her earnings by running a one-woman recruitment agency for ambitious and desperate young girls. They have four children: Talino is an arrogant wannabe intellectual who complains about being born into the wrong family. Betchay is a happy-go-lucky tomboy who has a penchant for stealing. Rosanna changes boyfriends like she changes shirts in a week. And Tan-G-A, the youngest, is the simple-minded but affectionate brother who is appreciated only by his sisters.
              </p>
              <p>
              The story of Pamilya Maleta takes the audience through the often comic, sometimes tragic tale of a family whose story can also be our own. Each time, it has never failed to regale the audience with its songs and its endearing brand of humor at one moment, and then move them to tears at the next, when Pamilya Inusisa seems to be at its lowest and when it triumphs in the end.
