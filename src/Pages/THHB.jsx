            The Horse and His Boy is the story of an orphan boy, Shasta, and a talking horse, Bree, as they journey towards freedom from oppression and slavery. They fly from a foreign land to Narnia, the place the horse calls home, and where the boy hopes to find who he is and where he truly belongs.
            </p>
            <p>
            Along the way, they are joined by a young noblewoman, Aravis, and a talking mare, Hwin, who both share their desire for freedom. Together they embark on a grand adventure through deserts and mountains, risk near capture, encounter danger, face the unknown, take part in a battle, and finally, find themselves and their destined place in the sun.

            <p>Reconnect with beloved characters from The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe - the grown-ups Susan, Edmund, and Lucy now reigning monarchs of Narnia, the faun Tumnus, and of course, the Great Lion, Aslan - and meet many new colorful and fascinating characters.</p>
