                Staged with highly dramatic lighting and the simplest of sets,
                First Name takes the audience on a journey through the Bible
                through the eyes of today's generation.The music, composed by
                Gary Valenciano and Ogie Alcasid, is arranged by Mon Faustino of
                Power Play and the result is a score that is dynamic, forceful
                and reflective of the new millennium.
