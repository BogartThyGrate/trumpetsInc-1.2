              <p>
                This retelling of the classic Hans Christian Andersen novel
                shows the meaning of unconditional and everlasting love, and
                what one little mermaid is willing to sacrifice, told through
                songs, movement, and vibrant storytelling.
              </p>
              <p>
                On her 16th birthday, Princess Jewel is about to assume her
                full-fledged duties as a Siren tempting sailors to jump
                overboard, give up their souls, and become slaves beneath the
                sea. However, she instead falls in love with the dashing Prince
                Christian and tries to find a way to be with him. Learning of
                Jewel’s secret love, Crustacea lures the princess into a
                dangerous deal. In exchange for human legs, Jewel must make the
                Prince fall in love with her within three days or else she loses
                her life.
              </p>
              <p></p>
              <p>
                When Jewel realizes that Prince Christian feels nothing but
                brotherly love for her, she is faced with a most critical
                choice: To end the Prince’s life in exchange for her own or to
                make the greatest sacrifice of all?
